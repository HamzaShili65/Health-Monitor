<h1> Heart Rate & Temperature Sensing Module</h1><br>

<p> A heart rate sensor that measures BPM and SPO2 and a temperature and humidity sensor. All data are displayed on the TFT touchscreen.</p>

**Background and Motivation:** <br>
The project is a combination of a heart rate sensor, a temperature and humidity sensor, and an LCD screen. The GY-MAX30102 heart rate sensor uses photoplethysmography - shining light on the skin to measure the perfusion of the blood in an artery - to measure a person's heart rate in beats per minute (BMP) and the level of Oxygen in blood SPO2 in percentage (%). The BMP 280 sensor measures temperature and humidity in the room. The data generated from both sensors are displayed on an LCD 2.8" screen for the person using the device to see them.<br>
<br>
My college life inspired me to create this project. As someone who's not used to Houston's weather and high level of humidity, I always wanted a way to measure temperature and humidity inside my room so that I can see if my AC is displaying the right temperature or not. Moreover, given the level of academic stress that college students go through, I thought it would be useful to have an accessible heart rate sensor to monitor how stress is affecting my heart beats.<br>
